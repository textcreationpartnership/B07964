            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She then being apparelled farre aboue her fathers e≈øtate, and ≈øet forth as if ≈øhe were an Earles daughter, grew very proud, and de≈øpi≈øed all young men and ≈øuiters that came to ≈øee her. And it happened afterwards, that both her beautie and ≈øpightfulne≈ø≈øe or ≈øcorne being made knowne to the world by them which had lodged at her fathers hou≈øe, ≈øome three rich Merchants of <hi>Antwerpe</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their way towards <hi>Francford,</hi> baited at her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hou≈øe. One of them being yet a bachelor, and a very hand≈øome man, was euen at the fir≈øt ≈øight that he had of her inflamed to loue ≈øuch a rare beautie:</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:184112:5"/>
            <p>And not long afterwards, hauing at ≈øeuerall times beene a ≈øuiter vnto her, he got at la≈øt her good will, and tooke the fruits of loue vpon great oathes and promi≈øes made before hand; and went thereupon to her father to get his good liking to the mariage, and ≈øpoke in this manner: It is now come ≈øo far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt your daughter and me, that if it plea≈øeth you we ≈øhall be two ≈øoules in one bodie: the father li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Merchant very well, ≈øaid thereupon, None ought to ≈øeparate them whom God hath conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and therefore if God hath appointed her for you, you ≈øhall not want my good will; and added moreouer, that if he would, he might in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of his two friends that came with him, make the ≈øpou≈øalls ≈øure both by hand and mouth: He li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this motion very well, tooke pre≈øently a ring with a <hi>Diamond</hi> from his finger, and gaue it to her ≈øaying, Take my mo≈øt beloued, &amp; receiue my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promi≈øe. This being done, her father made a fore-meale of the wedding to fea≈øt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome (as is v≈øuall in tho≈øe parts) and his friends. The other two Merchants hauing daily vrged the Bridegroome to di≈øpatch his affaires about the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they might aduance their iourney; he tooke his leaue from his ≈øpou≈øe, and went thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her father and mother to doe the like, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired them that they would take great care both for their daughter and her fruit, if ≈øhe got any; and promi≈øed them againe, that at his returne from <hi>Franckford</hi> he would come to them backe againe, with an intention to marrie their daughter, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184112:6"/>carrie her afterwards to <hi>Antwerpe.</hi> After his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture came many ≈øtrange cogitations in the minde of his deare≈øt, and con≈øidered by her ≈øelfe that if the young Merchant her ≈øpou≈øe came not backe againe, that ≈øhe ≈øhould be contemned, and blamed all the daies of her life, and that the people would point at her with their fingers and ≈øay, looke, there ≈øhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who is now paied for her great pride and ≈øpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈ø≈øe: But e≈øpecially ≈øhee troubled her minde, with the≈øe and ≈øuch like cogitations. When ≈øhe ≈øaw that the time was expired which he had appointed for his returne, and would not be appea≈øed by her Parents, who ≈øought to comfort her, ≈øaying, Be of a good minde, doe not mi≈øtru≈øt your ≈øpou≈øe, he is an hone≈øt man, and will ≈øurely come backe againe, as ≈øoone as his affaires will giue him leaue. She grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then daily more and more de≈øperate, it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that ≈øhe ri≈øing early on a Munday, put on her be≈øt apparell, and told to her parents with a ≈ømiling countenance, that ≈øhe had but little re≈øt the night before, and that ≈øhe conceiued in her fir≈øt ≈ølumbring, that the Merchant ≈øhould not come backe againe; but afterwards being againe fallen into a ≈ølumber, her minde gaue her that ≈øhee ≈øhould ≈øhortly ≈øee her ≈øpou≈øe, and I thinke ≈øurely that it ≈øhall happen, and am therefore now re≈øolued to walke a little abroad to recreate my ≈øelfe. Going abroad ≈øhee went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a wood that lay not farre from her fathers hou≈øe, and e≈øpied there a young man comming to her with his rapier on his ≈øide, and ≈øhe thought that he was her ≈øpou≈øe: (But alas ≈øhe was mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:184112:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>for it was the wicked ≈øpirit, who appeared vnto her in his ≈øhape and apparell) and bade him welcome with a cheerefull minde: and receiued thereupon a rich ≈øcarpe which hee ≈øaid that hee had brought with him to be≈øtow vpon her; and de≈øired thereupon that ≈øhee would yeeld vnto him her young and delicate bodie, for which he had longed a great while. Shee ea≈øily yeelding to his ≈øuit, went hand in hand with him towards the wood (in which ≈øhee yeelded afterwards the v≈øe of her bodie vnto him) and prote≈øted by the way, that in his ab≈øence ≈øhee had fetcht many heauy groanes for his ≈øake. But hee not being contented with her body, made her al≈øo to yeeld her ≈øoule vnto him; and wrung her head from her necke, (as ≈øoone as ≈øhee had granted his reque≈øt) making the whole wood to tremble and ≈øhake: and ≈øo made this poore wretch a mo≈øt mi≈øerable end of her life, being de≈øtituted of the feare of God, and onely giuen to pride, vanity, and worldly care. The father, and mother, longing for the returne of their daughter, learned afterwards by a ≈øwineheard what was become of her, for he knew her, and had partly heard and ≈øeene this mi≈øerable tragedy. They were both at the hearing of this newes much di≈øcomforted, and the mother fell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently into a trance. The next day, the young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant comming backe againe found the Parents of his deare beloued in this heauine≈ø≈øe, and asked them where ≈øhe was; who told him thereupon as well as they could this Hi≈øtorie, and told him that for his loues ≈øake ≈øhe had beene tempted and murdered by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184112:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Deuill: he being full of ≈øorrow and griefe, went thereupon out of their hou≈øe and hung him≈øelfe out of a de≈øperate minde. The Magi≈øtrate hauing heard that which was hapned, ≈øent pre≈øently the hangman to fetch the body of the Merchant, and cau≈øed it to be hanged on a gibbet, as is there the cu≈øtome of the land. Concerning her body it was buried vnder the gallowes. Her parents died likewi≈øe within the ≈øpace of few daies, being not able to beare ≈øuch a heauy griefe. This example may moue vs to pray to God that he will giue vs better mindes, and pre≈øerue vs from all temptation of the wicked.</p>
